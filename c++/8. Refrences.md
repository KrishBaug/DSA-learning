# References

A **reference** is an alias (another name) for an existing variable.
```cpp
int a = 10;
int &ref = a; // ref is an alias for a
```

## Properties of reference

1. Must be initialized when declared.
```cpp
int x = 5;
int &r = x;  // Correct
int &r2; //Error
```
2. Cannot be changed to refer to another variable once set.
3. No null references (unlike pointers)
4. Internally implemented using pointers but safer.


## Modify data through references
```cpp
int x = 5;
int &r = x;

r = 10;
```
It also change the value in x 10.

| References | Pointers | 
|------------|----------|
|Don't use dereferencing for reading and writing | Must go through derefernces operator to read / write through pointed to value |
| Can't be changed to references something else | Can be changed to point somewhere else |
| Must be initialized at declaration | Can be declared un-initialized |

## References and Const
We can use const before a referenced variable so that it does not change value.

**NOTE:** const applies to reference variable name. Not to original variable
