# Functions

# One Definition Rule
* Definitions can't show up more then once in entire program or Translation units.
* C++ rule that says every entity (variable, function, class, template, etc.) must have exactly one definition in the entire program.
* You may have multiple declarations, but only one definition.

```cpp
// Declaration (tells compiler it exists)
extern int x;  

// Definition (allocates storage)
int x = 5;

```

* One definiton rule : context
  1. Free standing variables
  2. Functions
  3. Clases (have to show up )
  4. Class member functions
  5. Class static member variables

## Functions
A reusable piece of code that can take a number of optional inputs and produce some desirable output.

```cpp
return_type function_name(parameter_list) {
    // function body
    return value; // optional if return_type is void
}
```

how to call a function
```cpp
function_name(inputs)
```

## function declaration and definition
* Sometimes it's more flexible to split the function into it's header and body and the code for each in different places.
* when writing libraries the people reading the code dont want to know how the code works but just want to know the name of function and use it.
