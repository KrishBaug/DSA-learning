# Arrays

* collection of elements of the same type, stored in contiguous memory.
* Accessed using indexing (O-based).

## Declaring and using array
```cpp
int scores[10] // An arrays storung 10 integers

```

How to access the element in array
```cpp
// you can assign element
scores[4] = 9
int fifth_element = scores[4]
std::cout << scores[4]
```
**NOTE** : Reading past bounds of your array : BAD!
// IT's going to read out something you didnt put there.

## Looping through an array
```cpp
for (size_t i{0} ; i < 10 ; ++i){
    std::cout << "scores" << i << "]: " << scores[i] << std::endl;
}
```

## Writing data into an array
```cpp
int scores[10]; // An array storing 10 integers 
// Writing data in array
scores[0] = 10;
scores[1] = 11;

//Writing out of bounds is bad
scores[22] = 300

for (size_t i{0}; i < 10 ; ++i){
    std::cout << "scores [" << i << "] : " << scores[i] << std::endl;
}
```

Initialize array at declaration
```cpp
double salaries[5] {12.7, 7.5, 13.2, 8.1, 9.3}
```

Array initialization: Ommiting elements
* If dont initialize all elements , those you leave out
* will be initialized to zero.

```cpp
int class_sizes [] (10, 12, 12, 11, 17)

for (auto value: class_sizes){
    std::cout << "Value :" << value << std::endl;
}
```

you can also declare values of array as constant
```cpp
const double[2]{1.0, 2.0}
```

## Size of an array
```cpp
// this done in c++ 17 and above
int size_of_array = std::size(scores)
```

## Array of characters
Direct print put
```cpp
char message [] {'H', 'e','l','l','o', '\0'}
```
`\0` is a null termination character.

```cpp
char message [6] {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'}
```

recommended way
```cpp
char message [] {"Hello"}
//An implicit '\0' character is appended to the
// end of the strin, making it a c-string
```

## Bounds of array
the bounds of an array mean the valid index range you can access.\
```cpp
int arr[5];
```

Valid indices : 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
Invalid (out of bounds): arr[-1], arr[5], etc.

If you write beyond bounds. The compiler allows it. But you don't own the memory at index 12, so other programs may modify it and your program may read bogus data at a later time. Or you can even corrupt data used by other parts of your program.
