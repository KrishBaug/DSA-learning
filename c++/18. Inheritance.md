# Inheritance 

**Concepts :**
* A derived class is class that inherits properties and behaviour of base class.
* Inherits data members and member functions (depending on access specifiers.)
* Allows code reuse and hierarchial relationships

**Syntax :**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Base class
class Animal {
public:
    void eat() { cout << "Eating...\n"; }
};

// Derived class
class Dog : public Animal {  // public inheritance
public:
    void bark() { cout << "Barking...\n"; }
};

int main() {
    Dog d;
    d.eat();   // inherited from Animal
    d.bark();  // own function
}

```

* Public inheritance: base class public members → derived class public

* Base class functions can be called directly by derived objects

* Derived class can add new members or override existing ones


## Protected Members in Inheritance
**Concept :**
* Protect members of a class are:
  * Accessible inside the class
  * Accessible in derived classes
  * Not accessible outside the class (unlike public)
* Useful to allow derived classes to use members while hiding them from the outside world.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Animal {
protected:
    string type;  // protected member
public:
    void setType(string t) { type = t; }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void showType() { cout << "Animal type: " << type << endl; } // can access protected
};

int main() {
    Dog d;
    d.setType("Mammal");  // public function can access protected
    d.showType();
    // d.type = "Reptile"; // ❌ error: type is protected, cannot access directly
}
```

| Specifier     | Inside Class | Derived Class | Outside (objects) |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ----------------- |
| **Public**    | ✅ Yes        | ✅ Yes         | ✅ Yes             |
| **Protected** | ✅ Yes        | ✅ Yes         | ❌ No              |
| **Private**   | ✅ Yes        | ❌ No          | ❌ No              |

**Differences**

* Public: Everything is open → both derived classes and objects can access.

* Private: Locked → only the class itself can access. Derived classes and objects cannot.

* Protected: Middle ground → only derived classes can access, but outside objects can’t.

**Why/When to Use**

* ✅ Use public if you want everyone (objects + derived) to access.

* ✅ Use private if it’s strict internal logic/data (not even children should touch it).

* ✅ Use protected when:

  * You want derived classes to inherit and work with data

  * But you don’t want outside code to mess with it

  * Example: a base class framework where child classes customize internal details.

**Example to Compare**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    int pub = 1;
protected:
    int prot = 2;
private:
    int priv = 3;
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void show() {
        cout << "Public: " << pub << endl;   // ✅ accessible
        cout << "Protected: " << prot << endl; // ✅ accessible
        // cout << "Private: " << priv; // ❌ not accessible
    }
};

int main() {
    Derived d;
    cout << d.pub << endl;    // ✅ accessible
    // cout << d.prot << endl; // ❌ not accessible (protected)
    // cout << d.priv << endl; // ❌ not accessible (private)
    d.show();
}
```
**Real Use Case**

* Suppose you’re writing a game engine:

* Entity has protected health → derived Player and Enemy can change it

* But outside code (like main) can’t directly modify health.

## Base Class Access Specifiers
When you inherit a class, the access specifier you choose (public, protected, private) changes how the base’s members are seen in the derived class.

**Code Demo :**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    int pub = 1;       // Public → "open to all"
protected:
    int prot = 2;      // Protected → "family only"
private:
    int priv = 3;      // Private → "locked inside Base"
};

// PUBLIC inheritance → keeps the same rules
class PublicDerived : public Base {
public:
    void show() {
        cout << "PublicDerived can access pub = " << pub << endl;
        cout << "PublicDerived can access prot = " << prot << endl;
        // cout << priv; ❌ Not accessible
    }
};

// PROTECTED inheritance → hides public from outside
class ProtectedDerived : protected Base {
public:
    void show() {
        cout << "ProtectedDerived can access pub = " << pub << endl;
        cout << "ProtectedDerived can access prot = " << prot << endl;
    }
};

// PRIVATE inheritance → hides everything from outside
class PrivateDerived : private Base {
public:
    void show() {
        cout << "PrivateDerived can access pub = " << pub << endl;
        cout << "PrivateDerived can access prot = " << prot << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    PublicDerived pd;
    pd.show();
    cout << "Main can access pd.pub = " << pd.pub << endl;   // ✅ still public

    ProtectedDerived prd;
    prd.show();
    // cout << prd.pub; ❌ ERROR (public became protected)

    PrivateDerived prvd;
    prvd.show();
    // cout << prvd.pub; ❌ ERROR (public became private)

    return 0;
}
```

```output
PublicDerived can access pub = 1
PublicDerived can access prot = 2
Main can access pd.pub = 1
ProtectedDerived can access pub = 1
ProtectedDerived can access prot = 2
PrivateDerived can access pub = 1
PrivateDerived can access prot = 2
```

1. Public Inheritance (class D : public Base)

   * Public in Base → Public in Derived

   * Protected in Base → Protected in Derived

   * Private in Base → stays inaccessible

   * Subclasses of Derived: ✅ still see Base’s protected.

   * Outside world: ✅ can access Base’s public.

2. Protected Inheritance (class D : protected Base)

   * Public in Base → Protected in Derived

   * Protected in Base → Protected in Derived

   * Private in Base → stays inaccessible

   * Subclasses of Derived: ✅ can access Base’s protected.

   * Outside world: ❌ cannot access Base’s public anymore.

3. Private Inheritance (class D : private Base)

   * Public in Base → Private in Derived

   * Protected in Base → Private in Derived

   * Private in Base → stays inaccessible

   * Subclasses of Derived: ❌ cannot access Base’s members.

   * Outside world: ❌ cannot access Base’s public.
