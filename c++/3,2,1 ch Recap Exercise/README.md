1. **Simple Calculator**:
   * Use functions for operations(+, -, *, /)
   * Handle input/output and variavles
   * Use control flow (if/else for operation selection.
   * Practice scope, constants, and arithematic.

2. **Student Record Management System:**
* use structs or classes to store student info (name, marks, ID)
* Implement functions to add, edit, and display records
* Use arrays or vectors to hold multiple students 
* Practice pointers/refrences by passing data around.
* Work with user defined types and modularity

3. Dynamic Array (vector) Implementation
   * Build your own dynamic array class similar to `std::vector`
   * Practice constructor, destructors, operator overloading.
   * Use pointers and memory management (new/delete)
   * Implement functions for adding, accessing, and resizing array.
  
4. Bank Account Simulation:
   * Create a `BankAccount` class with member variables (balance, account number)
   * Implement functions to deposit, withdraw, and check balance.
   * Use encapsulation (private/public) and constructor.
   * Practice constants, references, and control flow.

5. Simple File based TO Do List:
   * Use file I/O to save/load tasks
   * Create a class to manage tasks with functions to add, delete, list
   * Practice modularity by splitting code into files
   * Use arrays/vectors and control flow for menu driven interface.

6. Number Guessing Game:
   * Use random number generation
   * Use loops and conditional for guessing logic
   * Practice functions, variables, scope, and constants
   * Implement simple input validation.
