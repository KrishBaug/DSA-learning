# Overloading & Lambdas

**Exercises**

* Overload area() function for circle, rectangle, and triangle.

* Overload max() function for int, double, and string.

* Create a lambda that squares a number.

* Create a lambda that captures a variable by reference and increments it.

* Write a lambda inside a loop to filter only even numbers.

**Mini Project**
 Make a math operations toolkit:

* Use overloading for sum() (integers, floats, vectors).

* Use lambdas for custom operations (like modulus, power).
