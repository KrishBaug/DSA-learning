# Learning DSA with c++

I am begginer so need a bit of guidance
This all my notes
The roadmap I am following -->

1. **Programming & Language Foundation (C++)**
   *Book: A Tour of C++ — Bjarne Stroustrup*
   
   * Syntax brush-up (variables, control flow, functions)
   * Classes, objects, constructors/destructors
   * Pointers, references, stack vs heap memory

   * Standard Template Library (STL) basics: vector, map, set, string, algorithm
   * Templates & generic programming

2. **Core Computer Science Concepts**
   *Book: Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach — Sedgewick & Wayne*

   * Memory model, call stack, recursion behavior
   * Time & space complexity (Big-O, Big-Theta, Big-Omega)

   * Abstract data types (stacks, queues, lists)

   * Data representation: binary, hex, and bit operations

   * Concurrency basics (threads, async concepts)

   * File I/O and streams

3. **Mathematics for Computer Science**
   *Book: Mathematics for Computer Science — Lehman/Leighton/Meyer (MIT OCW)*

   * Logic & proofs (truth tables, implications, induction)

   * Sets, functions, relations

   * Number theory: GCD, LCM, modular arithmetic, modular inverse, fast exponentiation

   * Combinatorics: permutations, combinations, binomial theorem

   * Probability: basics, expected value, variance

   * Graph theory fundamentals: adjacency list/matrix, BFS, DFS

   * Matrix basics: multiplication, transposition

4.**Data Structures & Algorithms**
    * *Books: Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C++ — Mark Allen Weiss (theory depth)*
    * *Competitive Programming 4 — Steven Halim (problem patterns & tricks)*

Topics:

* Arrays, strings, and hashing

* Stacks, queues, deque, linked list

* Trees: BST, heap, segment tree basics

* Graph algorithms: shortest path, MST, topological sort

* Dynamic programming fundamentals & common patterns

* Greedy algorithms

* Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)

* Bitmasking techniques
